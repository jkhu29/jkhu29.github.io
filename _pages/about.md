<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span> 

I am a PhD student under the supervision of Dr. [Yanye Lu](https://nbic.pku.edu.cn/en/Faculty/Researchers/0a96455fce164e508fbe96162ef92f79.htm) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I also closely collaborate with Dr. [Guoqi Li](https://casialiguoqi.github.io/) and Dr. [Man Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eE4vvp0AAAAJ&hl=en) from the Institute of Automation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests primarily include **Unified Model**, **Computational Imaging**, and **Brain-inspired deep learning**.

My recent work primarily focuses on discovering potential inductive biases in unified models, while enhancing these systems through the lenses of pre-training, training based on these biases.

**Omni-View: Unlocking How Generation Facilitates Understanding in Unified 3D Model based on Multiview images**  
**JiaKui Hu**, Shanshan Zhao♯, Qing-Guo Chen, Xuerui Qiu, Jialun Liu, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Yanye Lu♯

**<font color = "#224B8D">Arxiv 2025</font>** \| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07222) \| [Code](https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Omni-View) \| [website](https://jkhu29.github.io/omni_view)

This paper presents Omni-View, which extends the **unified multimodal understanding and generation to 3D scenes** based on multiview images, exploring the principle that "**generation facilitates understanding**". 

Building upon Bagel, Omni-View consists of an understanding model and a generation model. The generation model is further composed of two specialized modules: one for texture and one for geometry. Trained via a two-stage process, Omni-View shows high effectiveness in scene understanding and novel view synthesis. Crucially, it unlocks the benefits of its generative capabilities to enhance the model's understanding performance.

**Auto-Regressively Generating Multi-View Consistent Images**  
**JiaKui Hu**$^\*$, Yuxiao Yang$^\*$, Jialun Liu♯, Jinbo Wu, Chen Zhao, Yanye Lu♯

**<font color = "#224B8D">ICCV 2025</font>** \| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18527) \| [Code](https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR) \| [blog (Chinese)](https://blog.jongkhu.com/article/mvar)

In this paper, we product the **first AutoRegressive-based multi-view image generation** model. It's motivation is:

Diffusion-based multi-view image generation methods use a specific reference view for predicting subsequent views, which becomes problematic when overlap between the reference view and the predicted view is minimal, affecting image quality and multi-view consistency. Our MV-AR addresses this by using the preceding view with significant overlap for conditioning.

**Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Degradation Classification**  
**JiaKui Hu**, Lujia Jin, Zhengjian Yao, Yanye Lu♯

**<font color = "#224B8D">ICLR 2025</font>** \| [Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PacBhLzeGO) \| [Code](https://github.com/MILab-PKU/dcpt) \| [blog (Chinese)](https://blog.jongkhu.com/article/dcpt)

In this paper, we report three interesting findings:
- Randomly initialized models demonstrate an inherent capability to classify degradation.
- Models trained on the all-in-one task exhibit the ability to discern unkown degradation.
- There is a degradation understanding step in the early training of the restoration model.

Based on these findings, *to ensure superior restoration performance, it is imperative
that the restoration model attains sufficient degradation classification capabilities before training.*
